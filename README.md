# Free Email Providers List

A list of free email providers and domains for disposable email addresses, spam email protection and temporary email accounts.

## Why?

I created this list because I find it useful. I use it to protect my email address when I sign up to new services. I also use it to test my own web applications. I hope you find it useful too.

## How?

I use this list to validate email addresses. I check if the email address is from a free email provider. If it is, I reject the email address. I also use this list to check if the email address is from a disposable email provider. If it is, I reject the email address.
